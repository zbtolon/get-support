# Troubleshooting for managing support tickets
{: #SupportTickets}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} ticket problems might include an inability to manage  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support tickets.
{:shortdesc}

## Linked accounts cannot add or edit support tickets
{: #ts_service_broker}

If you have a linked account, you might not be able to add or edit {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support tickets.
{:shortdesc}

You are unable to create or edit support tickets in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
{: tsSymptoms}

General problems with accessing and managing support tickets, if you have a linked account, could be caused by lack of more granular account settings in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Because there are more granular permissions that must be configured on accounts that were created in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, you might not be able to add or edit support tickets.
{: tsCauses}

To correct the problem, contact your {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} account administrator to set the proper access on your account. The {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} account administrator can correct the problem using the following steps:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} **Account** menu, select **Users**.
2. Select the user from the list.
3. From **Portal Permissions** on the user profile, select the **Support** tab and click to provide the user with proper permissions to view, add, and edit support tickets.
