# Support options for your offering type
{: #support-different-services}

You can use the Support Center to access your available support options. The support option that you receive is different based on the type of service you have. 
{:shortdesc}


## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} generally available service
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

Support is provided for problems that are determined to be a defect for services or container images that are generally available (GA) and provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. The case is addressed based on the severity that you assign.


## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} releases services or container images that are classified as beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they aren't production-ready. A beta release helps {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market. This assessment enables teams to make changes before it's released as a GA service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines the issue is a defect in the beta service or container image,  {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. Additionally, the case is assigned the appropriate 3 or 4 severity level.


## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} experimental service
{: #s-services-exporcont}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} releases services or container images that are classified as experimental, which you can try out. To view all available experimental offerings, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Then, click **Catalog**, scroll to the end of the catalog, and click **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Experimental Services**. These services might be unstable, change frequently in ways that aren't compatible with earlier versions, and might be discontinued with a short notice. These services aren't recommended for use in production environments.

You can get community assistance for technical issues for experimental services through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud?tab=Newest){: external} and other issues through [Developer Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/ibm-cloud.html){: external}. If a problem is a defect in an experimental service, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix.


## Third-party service
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. These services are provided by individual software entities, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

Support for third-party services is provided by the service provider. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. However, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} shares analysis with the third-party service provider, if needed, and can work through Marketplace with the third-party service to help solve the issue.

### Bitnami helm charts
{: #s-bitnami}

Offerings that are provided by Bitnami are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, and you manage the deployment and configuration on your own compute. Support for this third-party service is provided by Bitnami. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix for defects in a third-party service. Any issues that require a support case are opened in the [Bitnami charts GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues){: external}. To view all available Bitnami offerings, go to the catalog, and then select the **Bitnami** provider filter. 


## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} closes the case and refers you to the community or forum for assistance.
