  * Unplanned incidents or outages, which are posted as soon as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team becomes aware of them. Incident notifications are regularly updated until they are resolved.
  * References to security bulletins that affect the various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or the platform.
  * Other platform-wide announcements of general interest to you.
  * [An RSS feed to which you can subscribe](#subscribing-rss-feed).

You can find the Status page by choosing either of the following options:

  * Access it directly at [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Status ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/status){: new_window}.


## Best practices for monitoring status
{: #best-practices}

Use the following best practices for monitoring the status of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to stay informed and plan accordingly.

### Check for upcoming maintenance windows
{: #monbp-checmaintwin}

Check for upcoming maintenance windows posted on the Status page, at least once every 24 hours, by using one of the following options:
* Navigating directly to the [Status ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/status){: new_window} page
* Using the RSS feed or an RSS-to-email forwarder

### Check for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress
{: #monbp-checcurmaninprog}

If you suspect that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is not functioning as expected, check the Status page for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress. To report an incident that is not already listed on the Status page, open a support ticket by clicking **Support** and selecting **Add Ticket** on the menu bar or by accessing the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} help page.

### Take advantage of multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Foundry Service regions
{: #monbp-multpreg}

All users of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public automatically have access to the US-SOUTH, US-EAST, EU-GB, EU-DE, and AU-SYD regions. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Global Operations team manages all regions to avoid maintenance impacts and minimize the risk of incidents that affect all regions at the same time.

To switch regions, from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} menu bar, expand the region menu, and then select another region.

### Prepare for minor interruptions
{: #monbp-prepmininter}

In most cases, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can continue to be used normally, even during the maintenance window. However, minor interruptions of a service can't always be avoided. Running applications typically remain available even if the application management functions of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, such as starting and stopping apps, are temporarily interrupted. To maximize the availability of your running applications, run at least three instances of each application.
